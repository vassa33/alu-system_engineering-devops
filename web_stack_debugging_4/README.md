# Web Stack Debugging #4

>> In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out it’s not doing well: 
>> we are getting a huge amount of failed requests. 
>> For the benchmarking, we are using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. 
>> It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. 
>> let’s fix our stack so that we get to 0 failed requests, and remember that when something is going wrong, logs are your best friends!
